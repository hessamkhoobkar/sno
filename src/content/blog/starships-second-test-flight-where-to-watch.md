_**UPDATE**: SpaceX’s Starship reached an altitude of 148 kilometers shortly after the vehicle’s Super Heavy booster broke apart moments after separation. See [Starship/Super Heavy lifts off on second flight.](https://spacenews.com/starship-super-heavy-lifts-off-on-second-flight/)_

## Livestream options for Starship’s second test flight

The countdown is underway for the second Starship/Super Heavy test flight from Boca Chica, Texas. Liftoff is scheduled for 8 a.m. Eastern at the start of a 20-minute launch window. SpaceX hopes to demonstrate improvements to the vehicle after its first, unsuccessful test flight in April, including a new “hot staging” approach.

> A "late pressurization" issue on the second stage is causing the hold, according to SpaceX. (Seems like there should be a lot of pressure on this launch already.)
